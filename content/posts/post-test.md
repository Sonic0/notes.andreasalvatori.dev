# Title

We haven't yet printed anything in space, so we cannot use it to verify independence from the factory. Independence needs to be verified without relying on the printed space and without the need to be in the factory. This is where localization comes into play. We should be able to check the correctness of a change locally before submitting it. That way, we can continue making changes even when we are restricted within the factory.
